		Only `id=impress` is important here as that's how the script find it.

		### Configuration options that can be set on this element:

		1. To change the duration of the transition between slides use `data-transition-duration="2000"` giving it
		a number of ms. It defaults to 1000 (1s).

		2. You can also control the perspective with `data-perspective="500"` giving it a number of pixels.
		It defaults to 1000. You can set it to 0 if you don't want any 3D effects.

			1. The `id` attribute of the step element is used to identify it in the URL, but it's optional.
			If it is not defined, it will get a default value of `step-N` where N is a number of slide.

			2. Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name
			of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and
			the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation.

			Positioning information is passed through data attributes.

			In the example below we only specify x and y position of the step element with `data-x="-1000"`
			and `data-y="-1500` attributes. This means that **the center** of the element (yes, the center)
			will be positioned in point x = -1000px and y = -1500px of the presentation 'canvas'. It will not be rotated or scaled.

			data-rotate-x="-40" data-rotate-y="10" data-rotate-z="10"

			3. Scaled Example:  `data-scale="4"`, so it means that this element will be 4 times larger than the others.
			From presentation and transitions point of view it means, that it will have to be scaled
			down (4 times) to make it back to it's correct size.

			4. Rotation Example:  `data-rotate="90"` attribute, meaning that this
			element should be rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.

			5. 3D Example:  `data-z` position on third (Z) axis, here data-z="-3000"` meaning that element should be
			positioned far away from us (by 3000px).

			6. CSS3 Animation: class= `positioning`  `rotating`  `scaling` apply to the sentences or words
			    class= `slide` apply to the slides

			At the very beginning of the presentation all step elements are given the class of `future`.
			It means that they haven't been visited yet.

			When the presentation moves to given step `future` is changed to `present` class name.
			That's how animation on this step works - text moves when the step has `present` class.

			Finally when the step is left the `present` class is removed from the element and `past`
			class is added.

			So basically every step element has one of three classes: `future`, `present` and `past`.
			Only one current step has the `present` class.

			So to make a summary of all the possible attributes used to position presentation steps, we have:

			* `data-x`, `data-y`, `data-z` - they define the position of **the center** of step element on
				the canvas in pixels; their default value is 0;
			* `data-rotate-x`, `data-rotate-y`, 'data-rotate-z`, `data-rotate` - they define the rotation of
				the element around given axis in degrees; their default value is 0; `data-rotate` and `data-rotate-z`
				are exactly the same;
			* `data-scale` - defines the scale of step element; default value is 1

			These values are used by impress.js in CSS transformation functions, so for more information consult
			CSS transfrom docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/transform

	</div>  <!-- The end of the Impress id div-->

	<!--
		Provide the HINT:

		When the presentation step is shown (selected) its element gets the class of "active" and the body element
		gets the class based on active step id `impress-on-ID` (where ID is the step's id)... It may not be
		so clear because of all these "ids" in previous sentence, so for example when the first step (the one with
		the id of `bored`) is active, body element gets a class of `impress-on-bored`.

		This class is used by this hint below. Check CSS file to see how it's shown with delayed CSS animation when
		the first step of presentation is visible for a couple of seconds.

		...

		And when it comes to this piece of JavaScript below ... kids, don't do this at home ;)
		It's just a quick and dirty workaround to get different hint text for touch devices.
		In a real world it should be at least placed in separate JS file ... and the touch content should be
		probably just hidden somewhere in HTML - not hard-coded in the script.
	-->
	<div class="hint">
		<p>Use a spacebar or arrow keys to navigate</p>
	</div>
	<script>
	if ("ontouchstart" in document.documentElement) {
		document.querySelector(".hint").innerHTML = "<p>Tap on the left or right to navigate</p>";
	}
	</script>

	<script src="static/scripts/vendor/impress.js"></script>
	<script>impress().init();</script>

	<!--

		The `impress()` function also gives you access to the API that controls the presentation.
		ex: var api = impress();

		3 functions belows:
			1. `api.init()` - initializes the presentation,
			2. `api.next()` - moves to next step of the presentation,
			3. `api.prev()` - moves to previous step of the presentation,
			4. `api.goto( idx | id | element, [duration] )` - moves the presentation to the step given by its index number
					id or the DOM element; second parameter can be used to define duration of the transition in ms,
					but it's optional - if not provided default transition duration for the presentation will be used.

		You can also simply call `impress()` again to get the API, so `impress().next()` is also allowed.
		Don't worry, it wont initialize the presentation again.

		For some example uses of this API check the last part of the source of impress.js where the API
		is used in event handlers.
